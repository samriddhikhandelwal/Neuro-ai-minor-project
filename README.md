ðŸ§  NeuroAI - Brain Tumor Detection Web App

NeuroAI is a Flask-based web application that predicts the presence of a brain tumor using a multimodal approach:

It accepts both symptoms (text input) and MRI brain scan images (image input).

The AI model is based on a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) trained to classify brain MRI images as Tumor or No Tumor.

It provides results along with a clean, interactive frontend UI and feedback alerts.
